    <h1>About</h1>
<h2>Written by "The Guy Behind the Lens"</h2>
<p>Hi there!  My name is Thomas Green and I am that guy.  I recently moved from Savannah, GA up to the great city of Chattanooga, TN in the Spring of 2018.  
    Over the last several years, I have also made Photography big a part of my life.  Moving to Chattanooga I decided to start my own photography company.
    I wanted to create an experience that not only captured the moments that we all love and cherish, but also use my craft as a tool to to connect 
    with people.  Walking in Place, what a funny name.  Life is fast and comes and goes like a flash of light, lets slow down and enjoy right now.
